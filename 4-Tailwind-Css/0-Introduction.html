        Introduction to Tailwind CSS
    </h1>
    <p>
        Tailwind CSS is a popular utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to style their web applications
        directly within the HTML structure using predefined classes. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks, where you work
        with pre-designed components or write custom CSS rules, Tailwind focuses on small, reusable utility classes that
        can be combined to build complex and responsive designs efficiently. <br>
        With Tailwind, you don't need to switch between your HTML and CSS files frequently. Instead, you can apply
        styles directly to the HTML elements, saving time and reducing complexity.
